# Implementation Techniques for Intelligent Systems
A Procedural Content Generation module for generating game levels using the Feasible-Infeasible Two-Populations Genetic Algorithm. <br/>
The paper covers a number of PCG methods namely: Occupancy-Regulated Extension, Novelty Search, Minimal Criteria Novelty Search and
Feasible-Infeasible Two-Populations and illustrates the results obtained by incorporating FI-2POP into the <a href="https://github.com/ErvinCs/ivy-game-engine">Ivy Game Engine</a>.
